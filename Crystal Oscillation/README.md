Team Asteroid FPGA Development

Welcome Team! This folder will be the place to create your projects from. Whenever you push/pull an update, the files will be automatically updated so DO NOT
update untill you are ready to see the changes.

Our first project will be to find a way to manipulate the crystal oscillator(clock division) on the fpga to our liking. 

Make sure to log your progress here.
